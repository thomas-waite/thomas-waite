I'm a software engineer working in decentralised finance on the Ethereum blockchain at [Fei Protocol](https://fei.money/), part of the [Tribe DAO](https://docs.tribedao.xyz/).

### ðŸ“š Background
I work on the [Fei stablecoin](https://fei.money/), a digital currency that is soft pegged to 1 USD. It is part of the [Tribe DAO](https://docs.tribedao.xyz/) - a decentralised autonomous organisation that consists of a community and ecosystem of decentralised finance protocols and products. 

Prior to that I was an early employee at the ZK-Rollup and scaling company, Aztec Protocol; having previously studied Physics at Imperial College London.

### 👋 Hi there 
I'm a software engineer interested in Ethereum + DeFi, Machine Learning + NLP. 

### 📚 Background
I've been working in the Ethereum space at [Aztec](https://aztec.network/index.html), and before that I studied Physics ⚛️ at Imperial College London. My thesis was focused on computer vision - flying drones over fields, multispectrally imaging the vegetation and then using a combination of supervised + unsupervised learning to generate segmentation maps. I live and work in London :)
